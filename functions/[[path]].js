          apprehension of the true nature of reality.[3][6] It is often
          considered an experience which cannot be expressed in words.[6] While
          the term satori is derived from the Japanese verb "to know" (satoru),
          it is distinct from the philosophical concept of knowledge as it
          represents a transcendence of the distinction between one that knows
