You might have heard about Artificial Intelligence, but do you know what Python is? Well, it's a programming language that makes it easy to build applications and programs that can perform tasks like search and parse text.

It's also very popular in the industry of AI because it's easy for anyone to learn and use. In fact, it's so easy that there are many ways to use Python with AI, including machine learning and deep learning algorithms.Building artificial intelligence (AI) has never been easier thanks to computer languages like Python, where a few lines of code can do a lot of different things.

```
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Training data
X = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
y = np.array([1, 2, 3])

# Create and train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict([[7, 8], [9, 10]])

```


In this code above, we use the LogisticRegression class from the sklearn library to create a model that can learn from the given training data (X and y) and make predictions on new data (in this case, the coordinates [9, 10] and [11, 12]). The model will use a logistic regression algorithm to classify the new data points as either 0 or 1, depending on which category they belong to.





***And that's how AI with Python works :)***
